# 1.0.0

First version. To adapt this to something desirable:

* Remember to rename everything away from `bstrap`, including `.coveragerc` and the `bstrap/` folder.
* Update the `py38bootstrap` name, and update the README.md file.
* `devices/` folder demonstrates how inherited objects can be placed in a subfolder, while `util` folder demonstrates regular functions.
* `tests/` folder demonstrates an example `pytest` test structure.
